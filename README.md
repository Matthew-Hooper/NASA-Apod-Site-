# NASA-Apod-Site-
A website to handle NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. 

Basically, exactly as it says. This project uses NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API.
It takes the data from the API and puts them into tags. 

I even have it set to change which tag to use based on the media type. 
For some reason though it keeps thinking the current date is one day ahead of the actual date. If it's actually the 20th, it thinks it's the 21st. 

You can check it out live here - https://matthew-hooper.github.io/NASA-Apod-Site-/
It's still very much a work in progress though.
